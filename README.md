# Whether

P.S: The name is an attempted word play on Weather (the average climatic condition) and Whether (you wanting to know whether its hot, cold, or food kinda warm). Seems like it turned out to be an epic fail ðŸ¥²

> A weather application built with Vue.js displaying the temperature, date and dynamic background video animation. It recieves input from the user through a search box, and calls the API for whichever city requested.

## Want to contribute or try this out on your own?
Run this command on your local computer after cloning and start building!

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
